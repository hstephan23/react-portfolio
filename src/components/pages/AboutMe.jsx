          I am a young, up and coming developer. I am a current student at Brigham Young University, studying Business Management. I am also a current
          student at UC Berkeley, where I am taking a fall-stack coding bootcamp. I am proficient in Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, Sequelize, MySQL,
          and MongoDB. I am mostly self taught in Python, and it was my strongest language until I took the coding bootcamp, but everything in the 
          bootcamp was in JavaScript. So that is my current strongest language, but I am devoting time and energy to Python so that it can be my strongest
          language again.

          I hope to go into the development world to add value to a current company. Once I have gained more knowledge, I would love to create some 
          sort of startup and use the skills I learned along the way to make that startup the best company that I am capable of. I am interested in 
          AI, machine learning, and emotional health. I want to develop applications (web and mobile) that allow me to help those with mental and
          emotional health.
