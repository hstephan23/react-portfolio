          Thanks for coming! This is my home page, where there are many options available. My resume, portfolio, about me, and contact page can be reached.
          The contact page is still underdevelopment in the backend, but I can be reached at <a href="#">harrison@stephanclan.com</a> and there are links to my Github 
          account and LinkedIn profile below!
